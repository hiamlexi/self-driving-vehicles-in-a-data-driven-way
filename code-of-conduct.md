# Code-of-Conduct

## How do we plan to collaborate?
- Work in pairs, and individually when needed. Task delegation will be aimed to be pair-wise (however, as mentioned, will be individual if needed).
- Follow an iterative workflow, with three meetings every week, alongside retrospective meetings and reflections at the end of each week.
- Iteration planning meeting (Monday): Start of the iteration.
- Mid-iteration meeting (Wednesday): Track progress.
- Retrospective meeting (Friday): Review and integration.
- Make a list of tasks at the beginning of each iteration/planning meeting.
- Meeting days and times: Monday (1:00-1:30pm), Wednesday (3:30-4:00pm), Friday (12:00-12:30pm).

## How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?
- Throughout 3 meetings.
- Through Git activities.
- Utilize communication platform (Discord).

## How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?
- Friday meetings.
- Request-based structure.
- Document features and keep documentation up to date in README.
- Share materials through the main communication channel.
- Read pull request/merge request descriptions thoroughly.
- Utilize the wiki on GitLab as a knowledge base.
- Pair programming.

## What is our usual communication plan?
- Throughout 3 meetings.
- Utilize communication platform (Discord).
- Have pair-meetings.
- Collaborate as needed.
- Utilize GitLab platform for code comments and direct messages.

## How will we solve conflicts?
- Attempt to come to a consensus through discussion.
- Voting.
- Seek discussion with teacher/TAs.

## How do you plan to ensure responsible use of LLMs in your project and how do you transparently and traceably document the use of LLMs?


Our technique for utilizing LLMs is to leverage them for concept technology, exploring possibilities, 
and assisting in trouble-solving. However, it is vital to recognise that LLMs function as tools rather 
than choice-makers. We allow their use in scenarios which include brainstorming sessions, observe-taking, 
grammar correction, textual content refinement, and creative answer locating. For example, 
LLMs can be utilized for responsibilities like Assignment A5 bonus, however continually with 
the caveat that thorough verification or pass-checking of the LLM-generated answer or idea is vital.

We encourage the usage of LLMs for responsibilities inclusive of providing tips for documentation or 
assisting research endeavors. Nevertheless, we do no longer advise their use for making substantial 
unsupervised judgments or at once quoting large passages of textual content without proper justification.

The rationale at the back of this coverage is to uphold the integrity of our work by means of making 
sure that human judgment and creativity continue to be paramount. While LLMs can provide a treasured enter, 
they should now not supplant human reasoning or know-how.

We are dedicated to keeping an obvious document of any interactions concerning LLMs, encompassing issues 
related to their implementation and any changes made through group participants. These facts might be 
incorporated into our code repository (comment in code, comment on gitlab, or a folder, etc ), observed 
by contextual causes or specific messages. For instance, those files might also take the shape of screenshots, 
transcripts of conversations with LLMs, or bullet-factor summaries of LLM-generated ideas. We do no longer impose 
limitations at the layout of the documentation as long as it efficiently demonstrates the usage of LLMs and 
the related context.

To ensure traceability, we insist on testing ideas generated by LLM and incorporating such ideas into our 
work through code or human-authored documents. Direct copy-pasting from LLM output is not permitted unless
thoroughly reviewed and stated.

We will facilitate open communication within our team in the event of disagreement or discussion of the
use of LLM-developed resources. Any decision regarding the inclusion or exclusion of products developed
by LLM will be documented.
